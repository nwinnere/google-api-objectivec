# Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C for REST #

## Release History ##

### May-2016 ###

Initial public release of the JSON REST-based API library. This is spun out of
https://github.com/google/google-api-objectivec-client but redone for more
modern toolchains/SDKs and to switch the wire format from JSON-RPC to REST. The
changes allow the library to support more Google APIs and to add support for new
API features like media download.
